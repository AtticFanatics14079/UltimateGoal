- Add a backup system to end Sequence threads on stop/crash
- Make ConfigurationRR clean
- Rename stuff with people there so the names aren't garbage again
- Try to make this plug and play
- Deprecate useless methods

AFTER PUBLISHING
- Fix up various threads (e.g. PositionThread)
- Troubleshoot DriveObject with Pure Pursuit - VERY important (#)

Known potential issues:
- No way to recognize end of servo movement (?)

Shortcuts:
- -> means implies
- (?) -> not sure if needed
- (!) -> unsure if system works (aka needs testing)
- (#) -> priority fix
