- Need to update all objects with implementing type (e.g. DMotor implements DcMotor)
- Add a backup system to end Sequence threads on stop/crash
- Fix-up PositionThread (again) as it is very clunky and hard to troubleshoot

Known potential issues:
- No way to recognize end of servo movement (?)

Shortcuts:
- -> means implies
- (?) -> not sure if needed
- (!) -> unsure if system works (aka needs testing)
- (#) -> priority fix
